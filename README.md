# Practicum_House_Price
What features of a house will influence the price of the house? Given the features of your dream house can you be able to predict the sale price of your dream house. This project answers these questions and attempts to derive most important features of the house that influence how much the house will be sold for.
The project is a about a kaggle competition titled House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.We adopted the data from the mentioned kaggle competion.The purpose of the project is to answer a business question what are the most important features of a house which will influence the price of the house.
We will perform data acquistion and understanding using data visualization and transformation.We will utilize data engineering methods to determine feature importance.Finally we will apply machine learning algorithms such as random forest and SVM to predict and answer the business question.
For model evaluation we will use Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and for performance metrics we will utilize Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE).

# Installation
